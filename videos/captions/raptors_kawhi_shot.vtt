00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.690
Got to be aware of the inbounder
here if you're filling

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.090
it's off the Leonard defended by Simmons.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.080
Is this the Tiger?

4
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.560
15 fourth quarter points by Koit Leonard

5
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.900
and the game winner?

6
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.760
41 points.

7
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.440
How about the bounce

8
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.500
and look at the fans in Toronto.

9
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.260
They have had a lot of misery

10
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.700
the last few years.

11
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.980
And how about the validation for Toronto?

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.480
That's all great.

13
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.410
I was just telling them we
work on that every day.

14
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.280
The driving baseline.

15
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.850
I missed the last one short.

16
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.260
So I just wanted to put it up in the air
and got the shooters bounced.

17
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.460
And you had to work hard for it.

18
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.020
First you got Ben Simmons on you.

19
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.490
You're driving, driving, then Joe LMB.
He's really big.

20
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.100
He came up.

21
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.620
How did you have to time it
to get it over?

22
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.040
Joe LMB

23
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.570
man, just a lot of hard work
just went into my shot.

24
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.290
Like I said,
I just shot it as high as I could again.

25
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.360
And

26
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.680
you see, I got some lock on it and make
the ball bounce off and end up going in.

27
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.100
No, I was disappointed
missing that free thought.

28
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.380
So I really wanted to make that shot.

29
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.700
You played a lot of minutes.

30
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.740
You knew you were going
to play a lot of minutes.

31
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.420
How did you manage yourself throughout

32
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.420
the game to be able to come
up big in the fourth quarter?

33
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.340
I didn't really.
I just try to play hard.

34
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.720
Every possession.

35
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.420
We could have went home.

36
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.780
I wanted to just leave it all out
on the floor just in case you lost.

37
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.840
And.

38
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.600
I would have been proud of myself.

39
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.580
You're not going home.

40
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.580
You're leading this team
to the Eastern Conference finals.

41
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.540
But if you think about your journey last
season, you only played nine games.

42
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.610
You joined a new team with a new
head coach in a new country.

43
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.560
Did you have any doubts?

44
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.400
Yeah.

45
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.890
Last year was a very down year for me,

46
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.520
going through a lot,

47
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.480
but everything that was going on
and God is good.

48
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.660
I prayed every day and
ended up getting healthy.

49
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.660
Now I'm able to play basketball and
you can just see what he does for you.

50
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.700
Absolutely.
And you have Kia.

51
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.160
I got one more question.
You got sicker around.

52
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.080
All right.
You got the buck.

53
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.760
What are your biggest concerns?

54
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.920
I mean, the Bucks are very great team.

55
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.240
I think they were the only
team with 60 wins.

56
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.500
Hopefully this game seven prepared
us for Congratulations to one.

57
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.600
Thanks.
