00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.900
What up? What up? What up? What up?
It's your boy eat eat.

2
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.180
Welcome to another edition of school Days.

3
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.220
Listen to God.

4
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.820
I'm super excited.
Y'all.

5
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.460
I'm super excited.
Like I got the title y'all.

6
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.260
Look, I got the academic key code
for all my students out there.

7
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.580
All right, so here was the problem
when I was going to school.

8
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.580
Guys, I don't know why, but I always
focused on what I couldn't do.

9
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.300
I didn't spell very well.

10
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.980
I didn't enunciate very well.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.020
Like, English wasn't my thing.

12
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.980
I wasn't the guy that
reading and comprehension.

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.860
It wasn't my thing.

14
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.580
But unfortunately,
that's what I focused on.

15
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.260
And so for me, I should
have focused on math.

16
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.620
You know what I'm saying?
I should have focused on math.

17
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.940
I should have focused on my people skills.

18
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.460
I should have focused on the fact that I

19
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.380
was present and always
dressed and ready for class.

20
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.460
But I focus on what I couldn't do
instead of focusing on what I could do.

21
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.740
Chico.
So you got to do me a huge favor.

22
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.620
I need you to focus on what you do.

23
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.620
Well,
so you walk with a different level

24
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.660
of confidence, because I'm telling you,
when you walk around with a certain level

25
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.290
of confidence,
it's a certain energy you have.

26
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.290
There's a certain bravado you have,

27
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.620
like, there's certain things
that you can accomplish and do.

28
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.140
But on the opposite end, guys, when you
look at your weaknesses, it drains you.

29
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.210
When you look at your weakness,

30
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.210
you disengage like you're
not willing to engage.

31
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.620
So do me a huge fan.

32
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.210
I got the key goal for you.

33
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.260
If you're only good at math,
focus on that.

34
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.540
If you're good at math
and science, focus on that.

35
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.570
If you're only good in science,
focus on that.

36
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.260
If you read well, focus on that.

37
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.290
Like whatever you do.

38
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.540
Well, you focus in on that, right?

39
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.820
When I took English and turned it
into math, and I realized it's a formula.

40
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.800
Intro.
Body

41
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.060
conclusion.

42
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.540
Come on, intro.

43
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.460
I tell you what it's going to be about.

44
00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.740
Body support.

45
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.980
Body support.

46
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.900
Body support.
Conclusion.

47
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.900
Wrap it all up in a different way.
Bingo.

48
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.020
I start killing English when I turn
into math, it's your boy, et cetera.

49
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.170
You're do.
Don't lose your confidence.

50
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.940
Whatever you do,
don't focus on what you can't do.

51
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.170
Focus on what you can do.

52
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.450
Whatever you do.

53
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.060
Have home court advantage.

54
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.730
It's your boy et.

55
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.840
I'll see you when I see you.
